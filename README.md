### Introduction

Hello and welcome to my data analytics portfolio! 
My name is Voy Adamek and I am a data analyst with experience in finance and management.

My passion for using data to drive informed decision-making and my ability to effectively communicate complex analyses make me a valuable asset to any organization.

### Project 1: Healthcare Regression Analysis
In this project, I used R programming to explore a dataset containing information about medical charges for different individuals. I began by visualizing the relationships between the numerical variables. We then computed the correlation matrix to identify the variables that have the strongest associations with charges. Next, we created boxplots to explore the relationships between charges and the categorical variables of smoker, sex, and region. Finally, we built a linear regression model to predict medical charges based on the available data. 



### Project 2: SQL Business Database Management
In this SQL project, I worked with three different databases: employees, departments, and dept_emp. I used various SQL statements like JOIN and CASE to retrieve information from the databases, manipulate data, and merge tables. Overall, the project involved complex SQL queries to perform data analysis and generate meaningful insights from the multiple databases.


### Project 3: COVID-19 Global Vaccine Tracker
This dashboard displays global COVID-19 vaccination progress, including total doses administered, doses administered daily, and percentage of the population vaccinated in each country. Overall, the dashboard provides an easy-to-use, dynamic way to explore global COVID-19 vaccination data.
