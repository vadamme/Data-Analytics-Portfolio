-- Task 1: The SQL CASE Statement
#######################################

-- 1.1 Retrive all the data in the employees table.

SELECT *
FROM employees;

-- 1.2 Change M to Male and F to Female in the employees table.

SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name,
CASE
  WHEN gender = 'M' THEN 'Male'
  ELSE 'Female'
END

-- 1.3 This gives the same result as 1.2, but assign the name gender to the new column.

SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name,
CASE
  WHEN gender = 'M' THEN 'Male'
  ELSE 'Female'
END AS gender

-- 1.4 This gives the same result as 1.2 & 1.3.

-- Task 2: Adding multiple condition to a CASE statement
#######################################

-- 2.1 Retrieve all the data in the customers table.

SELECT *

-- 2.2 Create a column called 'age_category' that returns 'Young' for ages less than 30, 'Aged' for ages greater than 60, and 'Middle Aged' otherwise.

CASE
  WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) < '1990' THEN 'Employed before 1990'

LEFT JOIN dept_manager dm
ON dm.emp_no = e.emp_no

-- 4.4 Obtain a result set containing the employee number, first name, and last name of all employees. Create a 4th column in the query, indicating whether this employee is also a manager, according to the data in dept_manager table, or a regular employee.

#######################################

-- 5.1 Retrieve all the data from the employees and salaries tables.

-- 5.3 Retrieve a list of employee number, first name and last name. Add a column called 'salary difference' which is the difference between employees' maximum and minimum salary. Also, add a column called 'salary_increase', which returns 'Salary was raised by more than $30,000' if the difference is more than $30,000, 'Salary was raised by more than $20,000 but less than $30,000', if the difference is between $20,000 and $30,000, 'Salary was raised by less than $20,000' if the difference is less than $20,000.

We will need data from 'employees' and 'dept_emp' to solve this.
